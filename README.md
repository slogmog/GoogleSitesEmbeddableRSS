# GoogleSitesEmbeddableRSS
Embed your RSS Feed on Google's updated Sites.Google webpage without a CORS proxy.

As an alternative to hosted solutions you can use the following HTML and javascript to display an embed of your RSS feed in Google's new Workplace sites (Sites.Google.com).

We opted to use a Jotform to Google Sheets to Zapier RSS feed low/no-code solution for hosting our RSS feed but you can swap out the RSS feed with a self-hosted one quite easily.

This code was created with the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT4 llm.
